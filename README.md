My Project:
Initially we were two members as a team for this project but unfortunately my teammate left me in journey as he wanted to change his major. The project was actually to built a four page static website for a of bulding contractor. It was so challenging because I didn't know HTML and CSS languages. So, I had to learn some basic html for website layout and css for styling the webpage. I still have to learn alot. 
I understood how the links are created that we see through the internet. 
what ever challenge i have gotten, I used youtube to solve that.
